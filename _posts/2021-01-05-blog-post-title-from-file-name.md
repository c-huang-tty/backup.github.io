## Data Sharing [C++] [05]: Between Devices

There are various ways for communicating between devices. Depending on our target devices, we can either connect two devices directly using cables and transfer data using protocals like CAN, Serial, TCP/UDP etc., or we can transfer data in wireless ways using protocals like Bluetooth, ZigBee, WiFi etc. 

In my application, my aim is to transfer data between PC and Jetson as well as PC and Arduino. Therefore, I chose __UDP communication__ for the former and __serial communication__ for the latter one.
